# IoT-Smart-Street-Lighting-System

🌆 **IoT Smart Street Lighting System**  
An IoT-powered Smart Street Lighting Solution designed to optimize energy consumption, improve urban safety, and enable real-time monitoring of streetlights using sensors, microcontrollers, and cloud-based data analytics.

## 📌 Project Overview  

Traditional street lighting systems consume excessive energy and require manual monitoring. This project proposes an IoT-enabled Smart Street Lighting System that:  

- 💡 Automatically controls streetlights based on ambient light and motion detection  
- ⚡ Reduces energy wastage through adaptive dimming and intelligent control  
- 🌐 Provides real-time monitoring and control via IoT cloud integration  
- 🔒 Enhances safety by ensuring lights stay on when pedestrians/vehicles are detected

## ⚙️ Components Used  

- **Hardware:** Arduino/ESP8266, LDR (Light Dependent Resistor), PIR Motion Sensors, LED Lamps, Relay Modules  
- **IoT Platform:** Blynk / ThingSpeak (for cloud monitoring)  
- **Communication:** Wi-Fi (ESP8266 NodeMCU)  
- **Power Management:** Relays and energy-efficient LED drivers

## 🚀 Features  

- 🌙 **Automatic Dimming** → Lights dim when no movement is detected  
- 🚶 **Motion-Based Control** → Streetlights brighten when vehicles/pedestrians pass  
- 📡 **IoT Monitoring** → Real-time status and data logging via cloud dashboard  
- ⚡ **Energy Efficiency** → Reduces unnecessary power consumption by up to 60%  
- 🔧 **Remote Control** → Ability to override or schedule lighting manually

## 🔍 Methodology  

1. **Sensor Integration** → LDR detects day/night, PIR detects motion  
2. **Microcontroller Processing** → Arduino/ESP8266 processes sensor inputs  
3. **Smart Control Logic**  
   - Lights ON when dark + motion detected  
   - Lights DIM when dark + no motion  
   - Lights OFF during daylight  
4. **IoT Connectivity** → Sends sensor data & streetlight status to cloud dashboard  
5. **Visualization** → Graphs & analytics for usage and performance monitoring
